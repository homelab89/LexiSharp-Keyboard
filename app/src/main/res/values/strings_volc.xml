    <!-- Volc modes hint -->
    <string name="volc_modes_hint">Modes:\n
1. File recognition (standard, submit/query): upload after recording complete; slower than flash mode but supports Doubao ASR 2.0; recommended when streaming is disabled.\n
2. File recognition (flash): upload after recording complete; faster speed but does not support Doubao ASR 2.0.\n
3. Streaming (default): upload while recording; returns the final result quickly after stop; no incremental preview. Now supports Doubao ASR 2.0.\n
4. Bidirectional streaming (best experience): upload while recording with real-time incremental preview; lower first/last token latency; requires a stable network. Now supports Doubao ASR 2.0.</string>

    <!-- ============================================== -->
    <!-- Volcengine Settings - Feature Descriptions -->
    <!-- ============================================== -->

    <!-- Volcengine - Streaming -->
    <string name="feature_volc_streaming_off_desc">Uses file recognition mode. The entire recording is sent at once after completion. Suitable for unstable network conditions.</string>
    <string name="feature_volc_streaming_on_desc">Uses WebSocket streaming recognition. Transcription starts in real-time as you speak, providing faster feedback. Requires stable network connection.</string>

    <!-- Volcengine - Bidirectional streaming -->
    <string name="feature_volc_bidi_streaming_off_desc">Audio is uploaded in real-time during recording, but results are returned only after recording ends. Faster than file mode; slightly better accuracy than bidirectional mode.</string>
    <string name="feature_volc_bidi_streaming_on_desc">Uses bidirectional streaming. Intermediate results are displayed in real-time as you speak, with faster response times.</string>

    <!-- Volcengine - DDC (semantic smoothing) -->
    <string name="feature_volc_ddc_off_desc">Outputs raw recognition results without additional processing.</string>
    <string name="feature_volc_ddc_on_desc">Enables semantic smoothing to automatically optimize expression and formatting of recognition results. Experimental feature.</string>

    <!-- Volcengine - VAD segmentation -->
    <string name="feature_volc_vad_off_desc">The entire audio is treated as one sentence for recognition.</string>
    <string name="feature_volc_vad_on_desc">Uses Voice Activity Detection to automatically segment long audio into multiple sentences. Effect needs further testing.</string>

    <!-- Volcengine - Two-pass recognition -->
    <string name="feature_volc_nonstream_off_desc">Standard streaming recognition accuracy.</string>
    <string name="feature_volc_nonstream_on_desc">Real-time optimization of transcription results during streaming recognition.</string>

    <!-- Volcengine - First character acceleration -->
    <string name="feature_volc_first_char_accel_off_desc">Waits for stable recognition results before displaying text.</string>
    <string name="feature_volc_first_char_accel_on_desc">Prioritizes displaying the first character quickly to reduce perceived latency.</string>

    <!-- Volcengine - File recognition (standard mode) -->
    <string name="feature_volc_file_standard_off_desc">Uses file recognition (flash mode) after recording completion. Faster speed but does not support Doubao ASR 2.0.</string>
    <string name="feature_volc_file_standard_on_desc">Uses file recognition (standard, submit/query) after recording completion. Slower than flash mode but supports Doubao ASR 2.0 for better accuracy.</string>

    <!-- Volcengine - Model version -->
    <string name="feature_volc_model_v2_off_desc">Uses Doubao ASR 1.0 model. Compatible with earlier API versions.</string>
    <string name="feature_volc_model_v2_on_desc">Uses Doubao ASR 2.0 model (default). Better recognition accuracy and more language support.</string>
